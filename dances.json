The dance was devised\nsuch that the 2s and 3s are showcased representing Units 2 and 3. The\nvigour of the dance represents the high level of effort put in by students\nduring the course. Each dancer dances from several positions, similar to\nhow we have been taking the position of different dancers to demonstrate\nformations. That the ones are still during bars 9-24 represents spending\ntime observing other dancers and teachers during the course. The plentiful\ncurving and casting to change positions on the side lines was included to\ndemonstrate good kilt control (or lack thereof)!\n"
