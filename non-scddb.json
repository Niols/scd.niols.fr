Each\ndancer dances from several positions, similar to how we have been taking the\nposition of different dancers to demonstrate formations. That the ones are\nstill during bars 9-24 represents spending time observing other dancers and\nteachers during the course. The plentiful curving and casting to change\npositions on the side lines was included to demonstrate good kilt control (or\nlack thereof)!\n",
