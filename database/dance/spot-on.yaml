      Our lovely Unit 2/3 teacher Rachel Shankland started every day with a fun
      warm up dance and often described our better moments in dancing and
      teaching as “Spot on”. Thus, this easy warm up dance was born; the circles
      in bars 9-12 and 17-20 create perfect spots. Thank you Rachel!
