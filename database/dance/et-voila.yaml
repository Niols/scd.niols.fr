      side of the square each time through as persons in trio get reordered: the
      persons on the left, in the middle and on the right becoming the persons
      on the right, on the left and in the middle respectively.

      The candidates devised dances and created “The Doonhamers' Book”. This
      dance is for twelve dancers as there were twelve of us; it also uses a lot
      of formations included in the dances of Unit 2 – even if not always in the
      usual way!
