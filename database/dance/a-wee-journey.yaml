  This dance is written as a gift for Rachel Shankland and George Meikle that
  took such good care of us during our Units 2 and 3. The changes of direction
  give many opportunities for the men to flash their underwear as the RSCDS
  demands for Unit 2.

      A reel of six is similar to a reel of four in that all dancers pass one
      other dancer at each bar and take one additional bar to turn around at the
      end. It takes twelve bars to dance a full reel of six, and six bars to
      dance one halfway.
