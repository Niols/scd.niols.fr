      in St Andrews in July 2022. “I devised this dance at the 2022 St Andrews
      Summer School while doing Units 2 and 3 of the RSCDS teaching certificate.
      The dance was devised such that the 2s and 3s are showcased representing
      Units 2 and 3. The vigour of the dance represents the high level of effort
      put in by students during the course. Each dancer dances from several
      positions, similar to how we have been taking the position of different
      dancers to demonstrate formations. That the ones are still during bars
      9-24 represents spending time observing other dancers and teachers during
      the course. The plentiful curving and casting to change positions on the
      side lines was included to demonstrate good kilt control (or lack
      thereof)!”
