  I was one of Mervyn Short's musicians during Summer School 2025. As a trainee
  teacher, I was very impressed by the precision of his teaching: he invariably
  took the class through five dances each morning, finishing perfectly on time.
  I wrote the tune "Five Dances Like Clockwork" during one of these classes, and
  the dance followed naturally. Both are dedicated to Mervyn, whose example I
  hope to learn from.
