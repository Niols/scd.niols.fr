      on July 31st, 2022: “At the Saturday's ball at the end of the first week
      of Summer School in St Andrews, a fellow candidate told me that it is
      planned to write dances for our tutor, Rachel Shankland. Thus, on the
      following morning, at 6.30 AM, I started devising this dance.”
