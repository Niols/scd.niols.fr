  George Meikle played wonderfully for our Units 2 and 3, even if not always in
  the tempo we wanted. This dance can be danced in your choice of tempo to
  reflect this.

      If danced in jig or reel time, the 1st and 2nd couples need to finish bar
      16 in the middle of the set facing partner. After the poussette, 1st
      couple is already in second position and they therefore do not need to
      move down as they turn. 2nd couple do not need to step up.
