As a trainee\nteacher, I was very impressed by the precision of his teaching: he invariably\ntook the class through five dances each morning, finishing perfectly on time.\nI wrote the tune \"Five Dances Like Clockwork\" during one of these classes, and\nthe dance followed naturally. Both are dedicated to Mervyn, whose example I\nhope to learn from.\n",

Each\ndancer dances from several positions, similar to how we have been taking the\nposition of different dancers to demonstrate formations. That the ones are\nstill during bars 9-24 represents spending time observing other dancers and\nteachers during the course.
