<div class="note">Note: If danced in jig or reel time, the 1st and 2nd couples need to finish bar
16 in the middle of the set facing partner. After the poussette, 1st
couple is already in second position and they therefore do not need to
move down as they turn. 2nd couple do not need to step up.</div>

the tempo we wanted. This dance can be danced in your choice of tempo to
reflect this.</blockquote>
