            Devised by <span class="deviser">Nicolas “Niols” Jeannerod</span>
                in December 2025.
            
            
                <blockquote>
                    I was one of Mervyn Short's musicians during Summer School 2025. As a trainee
teacher, I was very impressed by the precision of his teaching: he invariably
took the class through five dances each morning, finishing perfectly on time.
I wrote the tune "Five Dances Like Clockwork" during one of these classes, and
the dance followed naturally. Both are dedicated to Mervyn, whose example I
hope to learn from.
