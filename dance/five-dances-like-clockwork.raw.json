As a trainee\nteacher, I was very impressed by the precision of his teaching: he invariably\ntook the class through five dances each morning, finishing perfectly on time.\nI wrote the tune \"Five Dances Like Clockwork\" during one of these classes, and\nthe dance followed naturally. Both are dedicated to Mervyn, whose example I\nhope to learn from.\n",
