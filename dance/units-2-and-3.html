<div class="devised-by">Devised by <span class="deviser">David Osgarby</span> in St Andrews in July 2022.</div><blockquote>I devised this dance at the 2022 St Andrews Summer School while doing Units 2
and 3 of the RSCDS teaching certificate. The dance was devised such that the
2s and 3s are showcased representing Units 2 and 3. The vigour of the dance
represents the high level of effort put in by students during the course. Each
dancer dances from several positions, similar to how we have been taking the
position of different dancers to demonstrate formations. That the ones are
still during bars 9-24 represents spending time observing other dancers and
teachers during the course. The plentiful curving and casting to change
positions on the side lines was included to demonstrate good kilt control (or
lack thereof)!</blockquote>
