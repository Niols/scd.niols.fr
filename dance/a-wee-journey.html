            Devised by <span class="deviser">Nicolas “Niols” Jeannerod</span>
                in July 2022.
            
            
                <blockquote>
                    This dance is written as a gift for Rachel Shankland and George Meikle that
took such good care of us during our Units 2 and 3. The changes of direction
give many opportunities for the men to flash their underwear as the RSCDS
demands for Unit 2.
