    "deviser-details": "I devised this dance at the 2022 St Andrews Summer School while doing Units 2\nand 3 of the RSCDS teaching certificate. The dance was devised such that the\n2s and 3s are showcased representing Units 2 and 3. The vigour of the dance\nrepresents the high level of effort put in by students during the course. Each\ndancer dances from several positions, similar to how we have been taking the\nposition of different dancers to demonstrate formations. That the ones are\nstill during bars 9-24 represents spending time observing other dancers and\nteachers during the course. The plentiful curving and casting to change\npositions on the side lines was included to demonstrate good kilt control (or\nlack thereof)!\n",
